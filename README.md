## Hi! I'm TheDude53.
I'm a front-end web developer from Eagan, MN.

Aside from my actual job, I run [a chatbot](https://dudebot-official.glitch.me), play Half-Life, and contribute semi-frequently to open-source projects. I've also  single-handedly managed the successful upgrade and deployment of a new environmental illumination system with zero cost overruns and zero safety incidents.
